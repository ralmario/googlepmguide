## Project Planning

### Project Kick-Off Meeting

Members: team members identified in the RACI Chart, project stakeholders, and project sponsor

#### Agenda

1. Brief Introductions (10 minutes): names, roles, and fun facts!

2. Overview of the Background of the Project (5 minutes): project history, shared vision

3. Goals and Scope (5 minutes): in-scope, out-scope, target launch date, milestones

4. Roles (5 minutes): responsibilities of each member

5. Collaboration (10 minutes): shared project tools and documents, and preferred communication tool

6. What comes next? (10 minutes): set expectations, what to do next for each member

7. Questions (15 minutes): clarity

**Best Practices:** assign a documenter, send a summary after the meeting, and invite attendees to ask questions

### Milestones and Tasks

#### Setting Milestones

**Steps:**

1. Check the project's main goal
2. List all that needs to be done. For big items that indicate progress, treat as milestones. For smaller items that don't need stakeholders' review, treat as tasks.
3. Assign a deadline for each milestone. Consult with team on how many tasks needs to be done for each milestone and how long for each task to finish to estimate the each milestone's deadline.

**Tips:** 
- A milestone usually marks a completion of a deliverable or a phase of a project.
- If milestones are unclear, list of all tasks that needs to be done, group related tasks into manageable chunks that lead to a milestone

### Work Breakdown Structure

**Steps:**
1. Brainstorm with your team to list the major deliverables and milestones.
2. Identify the tasks that need to be performed in order to meet those milestones.
3. Examine those tasks and break them down further into sub-tasks.

Templates:
- Use *[WBS-Brainstorm-Diagram.pptx](https://github.com/ralmario/googlepmguide/blob/bfbf7b10d3d9440980c1086970b79c2e87a33606/Documents/Project%20Planning/WBS-Brainstorm-Diagram.pptx)* as a brainstorming template or a simple guide.
- Use *[WBS-Spreadsheet.xlsx](https://github.com/ralmario/googlepmguide/blob/bfbf7b10d3d9440980c1086970b79c2e87a33606/Documents/Project%20Planning/WBS-Spreadsheet.xlsx)* as a main, complete template.

### Project Plan

#### Project Timeline

-  **Importance of buffers (extra time added in the timeline or *pasobra*)**: Adding of *task buffers* (used primarily if the task are dependent with external factors or people outside the team and must be used sparingly if task is within the team's control) and *project buffers* (extra time for the overall project) to account for unexpected slowdowns or delays;

#### Critical Path

**Steps:**
1. Capture all tasks on the project
2. Set dependencies of each tasks if applicable. A dependency is the task that must be completed before the other tasks.
3. Create a network diagram.
	- Components: Path of the work from the start to the end of the project (starting task and ending task), parallel tasks and sequential tasks, non-essential tasks

![Network Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/eaS7Mew.png)

4. Make estimates for each tasks.
5. Find the critical path. Add up the durations for all of your “essential” tasks and calculate the longest possible path, you can determine your critical path.

#### Time Estimations from Your Team
1. Asking the right questions
	- How long does it typically take you to [task] like this one?
	- how complex are the steps to complete this task?
	- What are the risks associated with this task?
	- When do you think you can have this ready?
2. Negotiate effectively
	- How much faster could you go if I gave you this?
	- What stopping you from going faster?
	- What teams you need to get involved to help you with this?
3. Empathy
    - Consider team workload (with other projects), leave and holidays

### Budgeting and Procurement
#### Tips and best practices
- Break the budget by **milestone**.
- Ask if the company has a **signing or spending policy**.
- Add additional budget or buffer funds for **surprise expenses**.
- Reference **historical data** from similar projects.
- Utilize your **team, mentors, or manager**.
- Add **timelines and tasks** to your budget.
- Categorize different types of costs to **direct costs and indirect costs** (overhead costs).
- Perform a **reserve analysis** (review all potention risks to your project).
- Add **Planned Cost** and **Actual Cost** column in project budget document.

#### Project Budget
**Techniques:** (1) historical data (past projects), (2) leverage colleagues and experts, (3) use bottom-up approach (breakdown costs into cost per item then add up), (4) confirm accuracy (double-check), and (5) update budgetfrequently throughout the project execution (based on baseline or initial budget during project planning)

**Steps:**
1. Break project over tasks.
2. Estimate cost of each item.
3. Add estimates together.
4. Add contigency and taxes.
5. Seek approval from key stakeholders. 

**Common Line Items for Costs:**
- Cost estimates (for each tasks)
- Material costs (hardware, software, equipment)
- Fixed costs (one-time cost, will not change throughout the project)
- Travelling expenses (travels and meals
- Miscellaneous costs (additional costs)
- Buffers and reserves (5% or more of the overall project budget)

#### Budget Management

** Tips:**
- 	Establish **a sign-off plan** and inform the appropriate stakeholders of any changes that occur (approval of budget change)
- Establish which key stakeholder or upper boss will **check for vendor or contractor time sheets and invoices** (Finance? COO?)
- **Don't add costs or spend additional budget** without approval of the bosses.
- Track everything related to budget which includes approved budget changes.
- Set an acceptable limit for budget overruns (in percentage, e.g. 1%)

** Terms: **
- **Cash Flow**: the inflow and outflow of cash on your project
- **CAPEX (Capital Expenses)**: an organization's major, long-term, upfront expenses, such as buildings, equipment, and vehicles;  assets that the company will own and keep
- **Contingency Reserves or Buffers**: unds added to the estimated project cost to cover identified risks.
- **Funding**: cash into your project
- **Management Reserves**: used to cover the costs of unidentified risks, this estimate is typically between 5–10%
- **OPEX (Operating Expenses)**: short-term or recurring expenses that are required for the day-to-day tasks involved in running the company, such as wages, rent, and utilities

#### Vendor Management

#### Procurement
**Typical Procurement Process:**
- **Initiating**: planning what you need to meet your project goals
- **Selecting**: deciding which supplies and vendors to use
- **Contract writing**: developing, reviewing, and signing contracts
- **Controlling**: making payments and maintaining and ensuring quality
- **Completing**: measuring your success

**Agile Procurement Management:** Concept of a living contract for external vendors

#### Procurement Documents
- **Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)**: created during initiation phase, to keep confidential information
- **Request for Proposal (RFP)**: created during selecting phase, outlines the details and requirements of a project to be passed on to vendors; view [guide and template here](https://github.com/ralmario/googlepmguide/blob/2fe0fe20b975697a5702f36d50f0b81d5c01818e/Documents/Project%20Planning/Request%20for%20Proposal.jpg).
- **Statement of Work (SOW)**: created during selecting phase, lays out the products and services a vendor or contractor will provide for the organization; view [guide and template here](https://github.com/ralmario/googlepmguide/blob/7494037c2ec2a7dfde73b20beee3dc2a3b96008b/Documents/Project%20Planning/Statement%20of%20Work.docx).

**Procurement Support**
- Have the **contract review by a legal team** or **legal advisers**.

### Code of Ethics
Code of Ethics for Project Managers (Project Management Institute): [Code of Ethics](https://github.com/ralmario/googlepmguide/blob/64a92ba6ca5830e96e30e430eb0cd73d7db6b39d/Documents/Project%20Planning/Code%20of%20Ethics%20-%20PMI.pdf) and [Ethical Decision Making Framework Ethics](https://github.com/ralmario/googlepmguide/blob/64a92ba6ca5830e96e30e430eb0cd73d7db6b39d/Documents/Project%20Planning/Ethical%20decision%20making%20framework%20-%20PMI.pdf)

### Risk Management

#### Risk Management Phases/Life Cycle:
1. Identify the risk.
2. Analyze the risk (likelihood and potential impact).
3. Evaluate the risk (which risks to prioritize).
4. Treat the risk (solutions or plans).
5. Monitor and control the risk.

#### Tools and Techniques in Identifying Risks
- **Brainstorming** - meeting with the team (diversity: different perspectives, experiences, skill sets)
- **Cause-and-Effect Diagram/Fishbone Diagram/Fishbone**: 
![Fishbone Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/yk7fcry.png)
- **Risk register**
![Risk register](https://i.imgur.com/CU2uTzR.jpg)
	**Steps to Create Risk Register:**
	- Define the problem (indicated as green)
	- Identify the categories.(indicated as blue rectangles)
	- Brainstorm the causes of each category (indicated as straight lines)
	- Analyze the causes (mitigate the cause)

- **Probability and Impact Matrix** - assessing risk, prioritizing project risks
![Probability and Impact Matrix](https://i.imgur.com/HRm6SNN.jpg)
    **In scale of high, medium and low:**
    - Probability: likelihood for a risk to occur
    - Impact: damage a risk could cause if it occurs
    - Probability + Impack: will determine Inherent Risk (measure of risk by its probability and impact)

#### Types of Risk
- Time risk
- Budget risk
- Scope risk
- External risk (environmental risk, legal risk)
- Single point of failure (catastrophic risk)
- Dependency risk (internal and external dependency)

**Types of Dependency Risk:**

**Dependency Graph Template**: https://github.com/ralmario/googlepmguide/blob/main/Documents/Project%20Planning/Simple%20Dependency%20Graph.png

##### Types of Risk Mitigation: 
- Avoid, Minimize, Transfer (shift the responsibility of risk handling) and Accept

#### Risk Management Plan
Contents:

1. Title of the Project

2. Author (Project Manager)

3. Created and Updated Date

4. Document Objective (outline risks to *Name of Project* and the plans to mitigate those risks)

5. Risk Register for each Risk Type (Risk Description, Risk to the Project [high, medium and low], Mitigation Plan)

6. Appendix (Probability and Impact Matrix):

![robability and Impact Matrix Sample](https://i.imgur.com/PMqr3j8.png)

#### Communicating Risks
- Communicate medium- and high-level risks to stakeholders

1. **Low-level risks:** simple email
2. **Medium-level risks:** direct email with stakeholder with more specifics on the risk and detailed explanation of its mitigation plan, with link to the risk managament plan, with subject line in the email: [Urgent]
3. **High-level risks:**: direct level of communication, meeting agenda, collect feedback and insights on the mitigation plan
