### Milestones and Tasks

#### Setting Milestones

**Steps:**

1. Check the project's main goal
2. List all that needs to be done. For big items that indicate progress, treat as milestones. For smaller items that don't need stakeholders' review, treat as tasks.
3. Assign a deadline for each milestone. Consult with team on how many tasks needs to be done for each milestone and how long for each task to finish to estimate the each milestone's deadline.

**Tips:** 
- A milestone usually marks a completion of a deliverable or a phase of a project.
- If milestones are unclear, list of all tasks that needs to be done, group related tasks into manageable chunks that lead to a milestone
