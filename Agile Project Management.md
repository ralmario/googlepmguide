### When to Use Agile?
- Project with high levels of **VUCA** (Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, Ambiguity) = Agile

### Popular Agile Framework
1. **Scrum** - led by a Scrum master, 3-9 team members, for open-minded team and management
2. **Kanban** - visual board
3. **Extreme Programming (XP)** - test first development (design, code, test, listen, repeat)
4. **Lean** - Continuous improvement methodology

### Scrum
- An iterative and incremental approach
- The Official Scrum Guide: https://scrumguides.org/

**Scrum Team roles:**
1. Product Owner (responsible for what the team builds)
2. Scrum Master (responsible of when to deliver value to users)
3. Development Team (responsible to deliver the product)

**3 Pillars:** transparency, inspection (timely checks of work), adaptation

**5 Values:** commitment, courage, focus, openness, and respect

### Scrum Roles
- Establish a **mission** (tells me why we're doing the work) and **product vision** (helps imagine what the work will be like when we're done)
- If you, as a manager, compelled to start telling your team what to do and interferes with the self-organizing nature, **the benefits of Scrum will begin to collapse**.

#### Scrum Master
- helps everyone to understand and implement Scrum
- managing the Product Backlog (source of product features, requirements, activities related with deliverables)
- facilitates scrum events, remove blockers, remove interruptions
- creating agreed definition of a done task

#### Product Owner
- ensures that the team is buildng the right product or service
- voice of the customer, owner and priortizes the Product Backlog
- help inspect, adapt, and plan the next iteration on a regular basis

#### Development Team
- do the work to build the product

### Product Backlog
- guide and roadmap of your product
- a living document (always updated), owned by the Product Owner, prioritized list of features/requirements

**Best Practices:**
1. **clear item descriptions**, includes essential details, such as an action and location
2. for the value field, rate on **how much it provides business value **(scrum team decisions)
3. for estimate value, **indicate how much effort the Scrum team needs to complete **(Low, Medium, and High), owned by the Development team
4. add an order or priority list

The goal is **to include as you can while not stressing about the unknowns too much**, you can study each tasks in more detail when it is higher on the priority list.

#### User Stories
- create a solution that's always centered around the user and the user experience
3 elements: User, Action, Benefit

- Use this format: As a [user role] I want this [action] so that I can get this [value].

User stories must be independent (no additional needed context), negotiable, valuable, estimable, small (1 story = 1 sprint), testable (**INVEST**).

- If a user story is too big, it should be broken down into smaller stories.
- **Epic** -  a group of collection of user stories

**Develop a acceptance criteria to each user story** (what can the user to with this user story, steps or features)

**Example**:

- User Story: As a **Virtual Verde client** (user role), I would like to **acquire a bonsai tree** (action) so that I** can have a beautiful plant and I can meditate as I trim the branches** (value).

- Acceptance Criteria:

**Best Practices**:
- include the following components: user persona (personality), definition of Done, tasks to complete the user story, and any feedback already provided.

**Product Backlog Template**: [Template](https://github.com/ralmario/googlepmguide/blob/main/Documents/Project%20Agile%20Management/Product%20Backlog%20Template.xlsx)

#### Backlog Refinement

**Best Practices for Refining the Product Backlog:**
- contains the appropriate items
- items prioritized by the Product Owner
- items at the top are ready for delivery with clear acceptance criteria
- items must inclues estimates or informed assessment

#### Relative Estimation
- comparing the effort of one task to another task and that becomes the estimate

**2 Common Relative Estimation:**
1. T-shirt Size: identify a task that is considered a "Medium" and compare it to other tasks and assign a T-shirt size
2. Story points: use of Fibonacci number to determine effort and risk
