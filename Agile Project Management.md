### When to Use Agile?
- Project with high levels of **VUCA** (Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, Ambiguity) = Agile

### Popular Agile Framework
1. **Scrum** - led by a Scrum master, 3-9 team members, for open-minded team and management
2. **Kanban** - visual board
3. **Extreme Programming (XP)** - test first development (design, code, test, listen, repeat)
4. **Lean** - Continuous improvement methodology

### Scrum
- An iterative and incremental approach
- The Official Scrum Guide: https://scrumguides.org/

**Scrum Team roles:**
1. Product Owner (responsible for what the team builds)
2. Scrum Master (responsible of when to deliver value to users)
3. Development Team (responsible to deliver the product)

**3 Pillars:** transparency, inspection (timely checks of work), adaptation

**5 Values:** commitment, courage, focus, openness, and respect

### Scrum Roles
- Establish a **mission** (tells me why we're doing the work) and **product vision** (helps imagine what the work will be like when we're done)
- If you, as a manager, compelled to start telling your team what to do and interferes with the self-organizing nature, **the benefits of Scrum will begin to collapse**.

#### Scrum Master
- helps everyone to understand and implement Scrum
- managing the Product Backlog (source of product features, requirements, activities related with deliverables)
- facilitates scrum events, remove blockers, remove interruptions
- creating agreed definition of a done task

#### Product Owner
- ensures that the team is buildng the right product or service
- voice of the customer, owner and priortizes the Product Backlog
- help inspect, adapt, and plan the next iteration on a regular basis

#### Development Team
- do the work to build the product
