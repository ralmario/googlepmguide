## Agile Project Management

### Introduction on Agile
- Iterations - shorter blocks of time

### Agile vs. Waterfall
- get customer feedback more quickly
- aims to reduce waste

**Differences:**
1. Requirements:
   -  **Waterfall**: product requirements document, formally approved project plans, a need for a change control board
   -  **Agile**: initial project requirements, dynamic changes through feedback, 1 iteration = 1 feedback session, prioritization of requirements
2. Documentation:
   - **Waterfall**: lots of documentation between phases and handoffs
   - **Agile**: shorter documentation. written as only needed
3. Deliverables:
   - **Waterfall**: deliverable in the end
   - **Agile**: smaller more frequent releases

### The Agile Manifesto (2001)
1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools (collaborate, work together)
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation (less documentation work)
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation (collaborate with customers early and often, react and adapt to feedback)
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan (accept and adapt changes)

### Principles of the Agile Manifesto (4 Themes)
1. Value Delivery
2. Business Collaboration
3. Team Dynamics and Culture
4. Retrospective and Continuous Learning


1. Value Delivery (5 principles):
   - Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
   - Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
   - Working software is the primary measure of progress.
   - Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.
   - Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
   - **Summary: Deliver as quick as possible, thus more feedback gained, simplicity**
2. Business Collaboration (2 principles):
   - Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
   - Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
   - **Summary: collaborating with customers often, feedback and priorities**
3. Theme Dynamics and Culture (4 principles):
   - Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
   - The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
   - Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
   - The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
   - **Summary: effective team culture, providing freedom and their own ways**
4. Retrospectives and Continuous Learning (1 principle):
   - At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
   - **Summary: learn and adapt to what's working and what's not working**

### VUCA environment
Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, Ambiguity
- Project with high levels of VUCA = Agile
