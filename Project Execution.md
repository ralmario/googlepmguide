## Project Execution

### Project Tracking (Project Progress)
**Common Items to Track**:
1. Project schedule
2. Status of tasks, action items and activities
3. Progress toward milestones
4. Costs
5. Key decisions, decisions, changes, dependencies, and risks

#### Methods:
1. Gantt chart
   - for project with many dependencies, tasks, activities, or milestones, larger projects
   - for waterfall project management
   - **Template**: [Gantt Chart Template.xltx](https://github.com/ralmario/googlepmguide/blob/main/Documents/Project%20Execution/Gantt%20Chart%20Template.xltx)
2. Roadmap
   - for huge milestones, quarter-based
   - **Template**: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mtRKyj4nS5fja25lFNsCC8ZMnd7Z81yx_z-MtOEj5HM/template/preview?resourcekey=0-pEIsQsu6t8oHR5WWlMHYvw#gid=1672256879
3. Burndown chart
   - for granular, broken-down look at each tasks, finishing on time
   - for agile project management
   - **Template**: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KTRguVRxejznvLWGov7-WsSQ4U5uPYl4jLQLyiIAIU4/template/preview
4. Project status report
   - **Template**: [Project Status Report Template.xlsx](https://github.com/ralmario/googlepmguide/blob/main/Documents/Project%20Execution/Project%20Status%20Report%20Template.xlsx)

### Risk
- The use of a change request form of the organization, sample: [Project Plan Change Summary Template.png](https://github.com/ralmario/googlepmguide/blob/main/Documents/Project%20Execution/Project%20Plan%20Change%20Summary%20Template.png)

ROAM Technique (Resolved, Owned, Accepted, Mitigated)
1. Resolved - risk eliminated permanently
2. Owned - owned risk and the owner will handle it
3. Accepted -  nothing will be done
4. Mitigated - reducting impact
- Template: https://github.com/ralmario/googlepmguide/blob/main/Documents/Project%20Execution/ROAM%20Analysis%20Template.xlsx

### Dependencies
**Steps to Manage Dependencies:**
1. Proper identification (internal, external, mandatory  - legal/contractual, discretionary - test tasks or need in order to decide the final task)
2. Recording dependencies (risk register)
3. Continuous monitoring (meetings)
4. Efficient communication

### Escalating Issues and Changes
- Escalating standars and practices
- Timeouts and retrospectives

1. Small change, individual: email
2. Big change, group: team meeting

- Escalation emails

### Quality Management
**Main Concepts:** Quality standards, planning, assurance, and control

### Customer Relationship Skills
Tips and Tricks:
1. Negotiation
2. Empathetic listening
3. Trust-building

- Ask open-ended questions
- Set clear schedule for communication
- Communicate with empathy
- Get feedback from customer

#### User Feedbacks
1. Feedback surveys
2. User acceptance tests, UAT (for softwares)

How to Conduct a UAT? (Agenda/Steps):
1. Welcome users and thank them for participating
2. Present your product to them
3. Start UAT test cases (through critical user journeys)
4. Walk users through a demonstration
5. Identify edge cases (or rare outliers)
6. Recap findings, identify issues, prioritize which issues should be addressed first

### Continuous Improvement
- Test your solution first to confirm if it solved the problem.

#### Data-driven improvement frameworks
1. DMAIC framework or Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control

   Steps:
   1. Define the business problem, goals, resources, project scope, and project timeline.
   2. Measure by conducting performance metrics and data collection for baselines and success metrics
   3. Analyze by finding the root casues of problems and its impact.
   4. Improve by implementing a reasonable solution to the problem.
   5. Control by implemeting changes and monitor.

2. PDCA (Plan, Do, Check and Act) framework

### Retrospective
Hold a Retrospective after:
1. Missed deadline or expectations
2. Miscommunications between stakeholders
3. Reached the end of a sprint
4. Product launches or landings
5. Record key lessons that other people can learn from

**Best practices:**
1. Blameless (Changing perspective and "you" to "we")
2. Reflect on positive and negatives

#### Conducting Retrospective
- Maintain a positive tone throughout the retrospective, encourage 
- Be considerate of teams outside of your own.

### Data Decision Making
**Types of project metrics:**
1. Productivity metrics 
   - effectiveness and effiency of a project (milestone, task, projection, duration)
2. Quality metrics
   - acepptable outcomes (number of changes - *inconsistencies from initial requirements scope*, issues, cost variance -  *diff. between actual and budgeted cost*)

- **Tools:** Workfront and Jira, Tableau

Productivity Metrics:
- number of tasks or milestones completed
- on-time completion rates
- duration (how long something takes)
- projections or forecasts

Quality metrics:
- changes
- issues
- cost/budget variance

Happiness and satisfaction metrics:
- happiness metrics (visual appeal and ease of use)
- customer satisfaction score

Adoption metrics:
- Conversion rates - *number of sales divided by the total number of visitors*
- Time to value (TTV) - *amount of time for the user to see value after a purchase*
- Onboarding completion rates
- Frequency of purchases
- Providing feedback (rating the product or service)
- Completing a profile

Engagement metrics:
- frequency of communication
- responses to emails or updates
- attendance at meetings
- level of input

### Data Analysis
1. Data on tasks and activities
2. Data or metrics that are most valuable

- Always update project plan as part of communication with stakeholders

**6 Steps of Data Analysis:**
1. **Ask:** What is the problem? Expectations?
2. **Prepare:** collect and store data
3. **Process:** cleaning data
4. **Analyze**
5. **Share:** data visualization
6. **Act**

### Data Presentation
**6 Steps for Storytelling:**
1. Define your audience
2. Collect the data
3. Filter and analyze the data
4. Choose a visual representation
5. Shape the story
6. Gather your feedback/trial run

#### Data Visualizations
- Dashboard
- Burndown chart
- Column chart
- Pie chart
- Infographics
- Scatter plots
- Bar graphs

#### Presentations
**Tips:**
- Be precise, be flexible, be memorable
- *Designing for five seconds* rule - audience should understand your visual in 5 secs.
- Backup approach if you need to shorten your presentation
- Practice, practice
- Use stories and repetition
- Create a conducive team atmosphere for feedback
- Be present, always listen and ask questions
- Recognize a job well done! Celebrate success

### Leadership
#### Teamwork
Factors that impact team effectiveness:
1. **psychological safety** (*with no risk of being labeled as ignorant, incompetent, doesn't lead to embarrassment*)
2. **dependability** (*reliable team members*): *clearly communicate expectations*, *create an environment where your team feels comfortable negotiating with you*
3. **structure and clarity** (*clear individual roles, plans and goals by*)
4. **meaning** (*sense of purpose*)
5. **impact** (*Does my work matters?*)

#### Providing Air Cover
- *Providing air cover* means there may come a time when you will need to prioritize the needs of your team over the wants of your stakeholders
Ways:
1. **Saying "No" without explicitly saying "No" paired with alternative solutions**
   - Gently push back with a polite explanation if a request made by them won't be possible to complete under the current constraints—the scope, time, and/or cost—of the project.
   - Politely offer to get back to the stakeholder with your response
2. ** Intervening from behind the scenes**
   - Avoid unreasonable request from stakeholders with your entire project team to avoid causing extra stress
   - Consult with selected team members and come up with the alternative solution

#### Team development and dynamics
Stages of Team Development:
1. **Forming** (Getting to know one another)
   - Set project goals, roles, and context on the project
2. **Storming** (team interacting and disagreeing)
   - Focus on conflict resolution, listen to problems and guide team
3. **Norming** (team is working together)
   - Codify and reinforce established norms
4. **Performing** (team works seamlessly)
   - Delegate, motivate and provide feedback
5. **Adjourning** stage (project wraps up)
   - Celebrate final milestones

#### Influencing
**4 Steps:**
1. Establish credibility (*expertise + network/relationsips*)
2. Frame for common ground (*know your audience*)
3. Provide evidence (*statistics + story*)
4. Connect emotionally.

**Common Mistakes:**
- aggressive approaches
- resisting compromise
- not enough time establishing credibility, framing for common ground, providing evidence and connecting emotionally (or focusing too much in the argument)
- assume that agreements can be worked out in a 1 conversation

**Sources of Power:**
1. **Organizational** (your role, willingness to share and listen to info, network and reputation)
2. **Personal** (knowledge, expressiveness, history with the person, character)

### Effective Communication
- email, instant messaging
- virtual meetings
- work management and collaboration tools

3. stakeholder reviews (buy-in and support)
4. project review/retrospective (leasons learned, celebration)

### Project Closure
**Criteria of a Closed Project:**
1. All work is done
2. All agreed project management processes are executed
3. Formal recognition and agreement from key stakeholders that the project is done

#### Closing Process
*For Clients and Stakeholders:*
- Decide the closing process: 1) A small closing at each milestone, especially if a milestone is final, 2) A formal, larger comprehensive closing phase at the very end, 3) Both

**Process if you selected to conduct the closing process after each phase/milestone:**
1. Refer to prior documentation if phase or milestone is met
2. Put together closing documentation
3. Conduct admistrative clouse of the procurement process (close contract, pay vendors etc)
4. Make sure all stakeholders are aware that a phase, or project is ending
5. Execute necessary follow up work

**Prcoess if you selected to conduct a formal, larger comprehensive closing phase at the very end:**
1. Provide the necessary training, tools, documentatio, and capability to use your product
2. Ensure that the project has satisfied its goals and desired outcomes
3. Document acceptance from all stakeholders (retrospectives, project completion project, formal sign-off)
4. Review all contracts and documentation, include the whole team
5. Conduct a formal retrospective
6. Disband and thank the project team
7. Do impact reporting or impact evaluation (what the project add value)

Demonstrating project impact:
1. Highlight key performance areas (how you met your objectives via KPI, schedule and performance performances, cost savings and efficiencies)
2. Use metrics to showcase your results:
    - Improvement in schedule performance
    - Revenue growth
    - Positive return on investment (ROI)
    - Increased external user counts
    - Increased percentage of internal users 
    - Cost vs. margins
    - High percentage of customer satisfaction 
    - Reduction in overhead
    - Reduction in technical issues
    - Time saved
3. Prepare an effective impact report presentation (play demos, testimonials, case studies)
