## Project Execution

### Project Tracking (Project Progress)
**Common Items to Track**:
1. Project schedule
2. Status of tasks, action items and activities
3. Progress toward milestones
4. Costs
5. Key decisions, decisions, changes, dependencies, and risks

#### Methods:
1. Gantt chart
   - for project with many dependencies, tasks, activities, or milestones, larger projects
   - for waterfall project management
   - **Template**: [Gantt Chart Template.xltx](https://github.com/ralmario/googlepmguide/blob/main/Documents/Project%20Execution/Gantt%20Chart%20Template.xltx)
2. Roadmap
   - for huge milestones, quarter-based
   - **Template**: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mtRKyj4nS5fja25lFNsCC8ZMnd7Z81yx_z-MtOEj5HM/template/preview?resourcekey=0-pEIsQsu6t8oHR5WWlMHYvw#gid=1672256879
3. Burndown chart
   - for granular, broken-down look at each tasks, finishing on time
   - for agile project management
   - **Template**: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KTRguVRxejznvLWGov7-WsSQ4U5uPYl4jLQLyiIAIU4/template/preview
4. Project status report
   - **Template**: [Project Status Report Template.xlsx](https://github.com/ralmario/googlepmguide/blob/main/Documents/Project%20Execution/Project%20Status%20Report%20Template.xlsx)

### Risk
- The use of a change request form of the organization, sample: [Project Plan Change Summary Template.png](https://github.com/ralmario/googlepmguide/blob/main/Documents/Project%20Execution/Project%20Plan%20Change%20Summary%20Template.png)

ROAM Technique (Resolved, Owned, Accepted, Mitigated)
1. Resolved - risk eliminated permanently
2. Owned - owned risk and the owner will handle it
3. Accepted -  nothing will be done
4. Mitigated - reducting impact
- Template: https://github.com/ralmario/googlepmguide/blob/main/Documents/Project%20Execution/ROAM%20Analysis%20Template.xlsx

### Dependencies
**Steps to Manage Dependencies:**
1. Proper identification (internal, external, mandatory  - legal/contractual, discretionary - test tasks or need in order to decide the final task)
2. Recording dependencies (risk register)
3. Continuous monitoring (meetings)
4. Efficient communication

### Escalating Issues and Changes
- Escalating standars and practices
- Timeouts and retrospectives

1. Small change, individual: email
2. Big change, group: team meeting

- Escalation emails

### Quality Management
**Main Concepts:** Quality standards, planning, assurance, and control

### Customer Relationship Skills
Tips and Tricks:
1. Negotiation
2. Empathetic listening

#### User Feedbacks
1. Feedback surveys
2. User acceptance tests, UAT (for softwares)

How to Conduct a UAT? (Agenda/Steps):
1. Welcome users and thank them for participating
2. Present your product to them
3. Start UAT test cases (through critical user journeys)
4. Walk users through a demonstration
5. Identify edge cases (or rare outliers)
6. Recap findings, identify issues, prioritize which issues should be addressed first

### Continuous Improvement
- Test your solution first to confirm if it solved the problem.

#### Data-driven improvement frameworks
1. DMAIC framework or Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control

   Steps:
   1. Define the business problem, goals, resources, project scope, and project timeline.
   2. Measure by conducting performance metrics and data collection for baselines and success metrics
   3. Analyze by finding the root casues of problems and its impact.
   4. Improve by implementing a reasonable solution to the problem.
   5. Control by implemeting changes and monitor.

2. PDCA (Plan, Do, Check and Act) framework

### Retrospective
Hold a Retrospective after:
1. Missed deadline or expectations
2. Miscommunications between stakeholders
3. Reached the end of a sprint
4. Product launches or landings
5. Record key lessons that other people can learn from

**Best practices:**
1. Blameless (Changing perspective and "you" to "we")
2. Reflect on positive and negatives

#### Conducting Retrospective
- Maintain a positive tone throughout the retrospective, encourage 
- Be considerate of teams outside of your own.

### Data Decision Making
Types of project metrics:
1. Productivity metrics 
   - effectiveness and effiency of a project (milestone, task, projection, duration)
2. Quality metrics
   - acepptable outcomes (number of changes - *inconsistencies from initial requirements scope*, issues, cost variance -  *diff. between actual and budgeted cost*)

- **Tools:** Workfront and Jira, Tableau

Productivity Metrics:
- number of tasks or milestones completed
- on-time completion rates
- duration (how long something takes)
- projections or forecasts

Quality metrics:
- changes
- issues
- cost/budget variance

Happiness and satisfaction metrics:
- happiness metrics (visual appeal and ease of use)
- customer satisfaction score

Adoption metrics:
- Conversion rates - *number of sales divided by the total number of visitors*
- Time to value (TTV) - *amount of time for the user to see value after a purchase*
- Onboarding completion rates
- Frequency of purchases
- Providing feedback (rating the product or service)
- Completing a profile

Engagement metrics:
- frequency of communication
- responses to emails or updates
- attendance at meetings
- level of input
