## Project Initiation

- **Cost-benefit Analysis** is the process of adding up the expected value of a project (the benefits) and comparing them to the dollar costs.
  
  - **How to's**: [Cost Benefit Analysis for Projects – A Step-by-Step Guide](https://www.projectmanager.com/blog/cost-benefit-analysis-for-projects-a-step-by-step-guide), [Cost Benefit or Benefit Cost Analysis](https://pmstudycircle.com/cost-benefit-or-benefit-cost-analysis/#:~:text=Cost-benefit%20analysis%20is%20a,during%20the%20project%20selection%20analysis)
  
  - **Project Charter Document**
    
    - A document that contains all the details of the project. 
    - Clearly defines the project and its goals and outline what is needed to accomplish them
    - allows you to get organized, set up a framework for what needs to be don,e and communicate those details to others
    - See *[Project Charter Sample.JPG](https://github.com/ralmario/googlepmguide/blob/e441590e578e086ed23739327b8c5a3dd43d7e05/Documents/Project%20Initiation/Project%20Charter%20Sample.jpg)*

### Goals

#### Setting SMART goals

- specific (how long and when you accomplished it), measurable (via metric, benchmarks), attainable (can be reached), relevant (makes sense, worthwhile, sustainable) and time-bound (deadline, time-frame)

#### OKR (Objectives + Key Results)

### Deliverables

- Reports (common deliverable)    

## Scope

- duringthe  initial planning stage

#### Combating scope creep (*padagdag*) (must be all in writing)

- Project plans (timeline, budget, resources) visible to stakeholders
- Ensure clear project requirements (a document), and get comments on them during the initial planning stage
- Come to an agreement with each role and responsibility during execution and status reviews
- Out-of-scope requests plan after scope finality (who can make formal requests, how will be evaluated, accepted, and performed)

##### **Project Requirements first, then Project Scope, then Project Approval**

Best practices for scope management and controlling scope creep:

- Define your project’s requirements

- Set a clear project schedule

- Determine what is out of scope (in agreement with bosses)

- Provide alternatives (perform a cost-benefit analysis, if necessary)

- Set up a change control process (review process)

- Learn how to say no

- Collect costs for out-of-scope work (document all costs incurred of out-of-scope work)

#### Use the Triple Constraint Model (scope, time, and cost)

3 constraints will affect one another; Adjust the other constraint to implement changes on one (must be necessary only). e.g:

- Scope (updates on features), Time (no extension) -> Increase costs

- Costs (lowered budget), Time (no extension) -> Reduce scope

- Costs (lowered budget), Scope (same features) -> Extend timeline
