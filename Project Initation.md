## Project Initiation

- **Cost-benefit Analysis** is the process of adding up the expected value of a project (the benefits) and comparing them to the dollar costs.
  
  - **How to's**: [Cost Benefit Analysis for Projects – A Step-by-Step Guide](https://www.projectmanager.com/blog/cost-benefit-analysis-for-projects-a-step-by-step-guide), [Cost Benefit or Benefit Cost Analysis](https://pmstudycircle.com/cost-benefit-or-benefit-cost-analysis/#:~:text=Cost-benefit%20analysis%20is%20a,during%20the%20project%20selection%20analysis)
  
  - **Project Charter Document**
    
    - A document that contains all the details of the project. 
    - Clearly defines the project and its goals and outline what is needed to accomplish them
    - allows you to get organized, set up a framework for what needs to be done, and communicate those details to others
    - See *[Project Charter Sample.JPG](https://github.com/ralmario/googlepmguide/blob/e441590e578e086ed23739327b8c5a3dd43d7e05/Documents/Project%20Initiation/Project%20Charter%20Sample.jpg)*

### Goals

#### Setting SMART goals

- specific (how long and when you accomplished it), measurable (via metrics, benchmarks), attainable (can be reached), relevant (makes sense, worthwhile, sustainable), and time-bound (deadline, time-frame)

#### OKR (Objectives + Key Results)

- Use *[OKRs-Scorecard-Spreadsheet.xlsx](https://github.com/ralmario/googlepmguide/blob/25a8da854687e4ce9695004b453dfe12f159a003/Documents/Project%20Initiation/OKRs-Scorecard-Spreadsheet.xlsx)* as a template for defining and tracking progress

### Deliverables

- Reports (common deliverable)    

## Scope

- during the  initial planning stage

#### Combating scope creep (*padagdag*) (must be all in writing)

- Project plans (timeline, budget, resources) visible to stakeholders
- Ensure clear project requirements (a document), and get comments on them during the initial planning stage
- Come to an agreement with each role and responsibility during execution and status reviews
- Out-of-scope requests plan after scope finality (who can make formal requests, how will be evaluated, accepted, and performed)

##### **Project Requirements first, then Project Scope, then Project Approval**

Best practices for scope management and controlling scope creep:

- Define your project’s requirements

- Set a clear project schedule

- Determine what is out of scope (in agreement with bosses)

- Provide alternatives (perform a cost-benefit analysis, if necessary)

- Set up a change control process (review process)

- Learn how to say no

- Collect costs for out-of-scope work (document all costs incurred of out-of-scope work)

#### Use the Triple Constraint Model (scope, time, and cost)

3 constraints will affect one another; Adjust the other constraint to implementing changes on one (must be necessary only). e.g:

- Scope (updates on features), Time (no extension) -> Increase costs

- Costs (lowered budget), Time (no extension) -> Reduce scope

- Costs (lowered budget), Scope (same features) -> Extend timeline

## Success Criteria

- Criteria must be established and tracked between the project timeline, not by the end of the project only

- Examples of success criteria metric
  
  - happiness metrics (satisfaction/ease of use)
  - customer satisfaction rate
  - customer adoption rate
  - customer engagement metric (participation over time)
  - business-oriented metric (sales and growth)
  - adoption metrics (usage without any issues)

- List methods/tools, frequency, and data owner of each targeted metric/success criteria

- Approve your success criteria to bosses (as a document)

- Use *[Success-Criteria-Template.docx](https://github.com/ralmario/googlepmguide/blob/25a8da854687e4ce9695004b453dfe12f159a003/Documents/Project%20Initiation/Success-Criteria-Template.docx)* as a template

## Project Roles and Responsibilities

## Stakeholder Analysis

#### 3 key steps:

(1) List all stakeholders, (2) Level of their interest and influence, and (3) Level of their ability to participate and involvement

**Four Quadrant:**

![Stakeholder Analysis](https://i.imgur.com/jVG60WI.png)

1) Manage closely, key players

2) Meet their needs, consultants 

3) Show consideration, keep in the loop 

4) Monitor, keep in the know

**Review**

1) Bosses/Directors
   
   - high level of influence
   
   - doesn't involve in day-to-day tasks
   
   - medium interest level
   
   Engagement:
   
   - communicate regularly but no daily updates (weekly)
   
   - ensure project satisfaction

2) Team members
   
   - both high levels of influence and interest
   
   Engagement:
   
   - daily communication to discuss project tasks

3) Users/Customers
   
   - medium interests and influence level
   
   Engagement:
   
   - get feedback
   
   - occasional check-ins only

4) Investors
   
   - low interest in daily operations
   
   - medium influence, can affect the budget
   
   Engagement:
   
   - giving periodic updates on project milestones and performance

5) Employees involved after the project launch (e.g receptionist)
   
   - low influence and interest
   
   Engagement:
   
   - when the project nears completion
   
   - discuss details later in the process
